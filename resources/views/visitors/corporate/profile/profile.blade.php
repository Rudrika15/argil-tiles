                    complacent.</h5>
                <h5 class="paragraph1">The channel partners of ARGIL, retailers, distributors and dealers, have
                    always had faith in the company and the management. Every time we have introduced a new sub brand or a
                    product range they have been eagerly waiting to introduce and promote the same to the customers and

                    confidence and faith in the brand. lt is a matterofhonorto have such partners in business. This year,
                    2016, we have set a new goal and a long term vision for the ARGIL GROUP. I am confident that we will

                    sole purpose."</h5>
                <h3 class="paragraph-title">History</h3>
                <h5 class="paragraph2">India's greatest entrepreneurial stories are all epics within themselves. One
                    of those is the story of the Argil Group of companies. Shri Motbhai Prajapati was a potter at Sultanpur,
                    a very small village. He was blessed with a son, who was destined to create history in the region. We
                    know him now as Shri Amarshibhai Prajapati. Since a young age, he was helping his father in the work of
                    pottery where he attained technical expertise in the workings of clay. His father shifted to Morbi
                    employed at Parshuram Pottery. The family and the young boy too moved to the place where he would later
                    set up one of the most admired ceramic brands of the world. Shri Amarshibhai too worked in the same
                    factory for 8 to 10 years working in different roles, ranging from a manufacture of glazed jars to
                    plaster turning moulder. He moved on to Junagadh District to serve as a moulder fro 2 years in Kathiawad
                    Industries Ltd. People destined to create history are always blessed with astute vision of things to
                    come and determination to articulate the vision into reality. Shri Amarshibhai was no different. While
                    still employed he saw a heap of Mangalore roof tiles which were manufactured in Mangalore South India
                    only. Manglaore roofing tiles' main ingredient was Black and Red clay, which was available in abundance
                    in Morbi. The nearness to the raw material and his technical know-how of clay encouraged him to start
                    his own production of roofing tiles.</h5>
                <h5 class="paragraph2">With the zeal of an entrepreneur, he returned to Morbi. With numerous trials,
                    lot of experimentation and tremendous research, he could not design the best product or the system to
                    mass manufacture roof tiles. While many would have given up, he was not the one to throw in the towel.
                    He worked harder ever determined to make something big. Finally, he succeeded in developing durable
                    beautiful Mangalore Tile. He also devised a very efficient production system to mass manufacture tiles.
                    Trained man power was available in Morbi and that acted as a strong catalyst to start fast. Prajapat
                    Tiles Company was formed in 1952. Funding was the biggest challenge as the Family had very little saved.
                    Most of the initial capital was borrowed and a small manufacturing unit was commissioned by Shri
                    Prajapati and his team. Being the first of its kind manufacturing unit in the region and a very heavy
                    demand of Mangalore tiles, 100% production was sold.</h5>
                <h5 class="paragraph2" data-aos="fade-up">The founder had witnessed good & bad days. He never wished
                    his brothers to go through the terrible struggle hence he started training his brothers, technically and
                    commercially. Each of them was given a separate unit to manage. In modern day management we would term
                    these as profit centers and each brother a profit centre head. The flagship company though remained
                    Prajapat Tiles Co.</h5>
                <h5 class="paragraph2" data-aos="fade-up">Stability is a limiting belief for those with big dreams
                    and an even greater appetite for betterment of life. The founder did not rest on the laurels of this
                    achievement. In the year 1999 he established ARGIL brand which manufactured and supplied high quality
                    wall tiles. It is one of the most admired wall tile brands in India today. Innovation and growth always
                    go hand in hand. In the year 2010 the company ahs recently launched Quartz Stone unit. The first of its
                    kind in India, it has the most vibrant product range in the segment. You will read about the company
                    capacities and their product range in the coming sections of the profile.</h5>
